# Employee Retirement and Mentorship Program Analysis 

## Overview

From the initial analysis, there appeared to be a large number of employees reaching retirement age in a short span of time. In order to best prepare for upcoming changes, the following analysis was completed. The first deliverable was to determine how many employees are retiring by job title.  To help pass on knowledge from those retiring, a potential mentorship program is being considered. The second deliverable was to identify those employees who may be eligible to participate in this mentorship program.

## Results

The following are four noted points from the analysis described above.

* The group facing the biggest loss as a large number of employees reach retirement age are those with the job title of Senior Engineer.  Senior Staff comes in as a very close second.  These senior positions are to be expected as those who are reaching retirement age likely have a great amount of knowledge and hold senior positions within the company.

* From the image above, it is also noted that the position of Engineer will also face substantial losses over a potentially short period. Those holding position of Assistant Engineer have potential to move into an Engineer position in an effort to foster promotion from within.

* There is just under 2,000 employees eligible for the mentorship program. These are current employees that the company has a great opportunity to invest in for the benefit of the employee and the company both. Promoting from within can boost morale and reduce hiring efforts on staff that potentially may be short staffed with retirements impending. Utilizing the knowledge and passing it down to current employees should be prioritized.

* The employees eligible for the mentorship program have been employeed with the company for roughly 20-30 years. The company appears to be one that the employees enjoy working for. A mentorship program is a fantastic addition to what the company already offers its employees.

## Summary

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

90,398 employees comprise the "silver tsunami".

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Yes, I think there should be but that does depend on the mentorship program and what that looks like from a company stand-point.
